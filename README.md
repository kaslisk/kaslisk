most of my stuff are private due to course/competition/company regulation like data security, plagiarism concerns or sometimes the dataset is just too large to be uploaded on github.

a lot of my data science projects use kaggle data so it makes more sense to store them there, except kaggle notebooks are notoriously slow (at least for me).

i am interested in exploring vibe based solutions to financial modelling and data science.
